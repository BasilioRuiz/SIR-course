I have created the directory $HOME/SIRstuff to download all the material and to solve the exercises

1) downloading the program

go to https://github.com/BasilioRuiz/SIR-code

download SIR-code_master.zip in $HOME/SIRstuff

> cd SIR-code-master

> ls
      Barklem  compiling_running.txt  default  idl  manual  models  Readme  SIR2017.tar.gz  test

> mkdir program

> mv SIR2017.tar.gz ./program

> cd program

> gunzip *.gz

> tar -xvf *.tar

> make fc=gfortran sir.x

> make fc=gfortran modelador3.x

> cd ..

2) downloading exercises

https://github.com/BasilioRuiz/SIR-course

> ls
  SIR-code-master  SIR-course-master
  
> cd SIR-course-master
>  ls 
   Readme  SIR__course.pdf  SIR__course.pptx  SIR_exercises
   
> cd ..


3) We can define paths in our ".cshrc" file (if csh or tcsh) adding the lines:

setenv _program      $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-code-master/program
setenv _default      $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-code-master/default
setenv _idl          $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-code-master/idl
setenv _models       $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-code-master/models
setenv _exercise1    $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise1
setenv _exercise2    $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise2
setenv _exercise3    $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise3
setenv _exercise4    $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise4
setenv _exercise4bis $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise4bis
setenv _exercise5    $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise5
setenv _exercise6    $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise6
setenv _exercise7    $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise7
setenv _exercise7bis $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise7bis
setenv _exercise8    $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise8
setenv _exercise9    $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-course-master/SIR_exercises/exercise9

> source .cshrc

4) 
In order to change the IDL paths I look for the idl start up file in .cshrc 

more .cshrc
   in my case it says: 
   setenv IDL_STARTUP   $HOME/idl.startup

   Then we edit "idl.startup" to include the new path:
   
   kile $HOME/idl.startup
   and include the line
   !path = !path + ":" + expand_path("+$HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-code-master/_idl")

In order to check the inversion results it is very usefule the idl tool graphics2.
If you run it from idl, you will obtain an error message, because graphics2 it is 
looking for the file "scales" in your home $HOME/bin/scales. 
You can move the file scales (that you can find in $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-code-master/idl/scales)
to your $HOME/bin or well you can edit graphics2.pro. You will need to edit two lines: the 418 and 1595
   
418    openr,1,'$HOME/bin/scales'  
  change it by 
       openr,1,'$HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-code-master/idl/scales'
  
  and also the 1595
  
1595   spawn,'emacs $HOME/bin/scales'
  change it by 
      spawn,'emacs $HOME/SIRstuff/SIR-code-master/idl/scales'
      
      
5) ***  It is a good idea to have 2 consoles in the same directory one for idl and other as a terminal
