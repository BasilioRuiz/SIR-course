we can start with a QS model +200 G , g=45º & phi=30.

cp []/sir/models/hsra11.mod .
cp []/sir/models/model.mtrol .

echo model.mtrol | []/modelador3.x

We edit guess-plage.mod introducing a stray light factor=20 %

Result: we can reproduce the observed profiles, but
with a 95% of stray-light
- cross gradients of B and Vz (as in a canopy)
- very horizontal fields (noise in Q, U --> gamma~90º)
