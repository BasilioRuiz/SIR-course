We have 5 points over an active region including a sunspot.
The spectra correspond to:
1: penumbra
2: light bridge
3: umbra
4: facular point close to a sunspot with opposite polarity
5: facular point close to a sunspot with the same polarity



mkdir Ex8
cd Ex8

;In the terminal 
cp $_exercise8/* .

1) We have the profiles for the 5 points at coordinates 
 
firs_px1=438 & firs_py1=130
firs_px2=388 & firs_py2=175
firs_px3=400 & firs_py3=206
firs_px4=272 & firs_py4=200
firs_px5=460 & firs_py5=242


2) We copy and modify a penumbral model, for instance

cp $_models/penumjti11.mod .

IDL> read_model,'penumjti11.mod',logtau,t,pe,mic,b,vz,g,f,z,pg,rho,mac,fill,stray
IDL> b=b*0.+1500. & vz=vz*0. & g=g*0.+45 & f=f*0.+30.
IDL> write_model,'guess1.mod',logtau,t,pe,mic,b,vz,g,f,z,pg,rho,mac,fill,stray

As we want to do several inversions we make some copies of guess1.mod
cp guess1.mod guess2.mod
cp guess1.mod guess3.mod
cp guess1.mod guess4.mod
cp guess1.mod guess5.mod


3) We invert using 2 cycles allowing micro and macro
We edit FIRS1.trol  (cp /home/brc/Curso/BRC/SIR_exercises/exercise8/solution/*.trol .
cp $_default/sir.trol .

kwrite sir.trol --> FIRS1.trol

Invert macroturbulence 1?    :1                ! (0 or blank=no, 1=yes)


and then we copy this in other 4 files
cp FIRS1.mod FIRS2.mod and then modify the input model and output profile name
cp FIRS1.mod FIRS3.mod
cp FIRS1.mod FIRS4.mod
cp FIRS1.mod FIRS5.mod

echo FIRS1.trol | $_program/sir.x
echo FIRS2.trol | $_program/sir.x
etc


we check the results
IDL> graphics2


We can check than for;
1: penumbra
  The fits are reasonably good (except Stokes U core)
  Temperatures are similar to to guess model (typical of a penumbra) 
  We obtain a significant b gradient growing with height from .8 to 1.2 kG
  The velocity gradient is compatible with 0. Vz around -2 km/s
  The inclination gradient is compatible with 0. garound 73 degrees
  A strong gradient in azimuth (from 60 to 115 degrees)


2: light bridge
  Q is badly matched. U-cosre is not too good 
  We obtain a cooler model
  We obtain a significant b gradient growing with height from 1.4 to 2.1 kG
  The velocity gradient is compatible with 0. Vz around -2 km/s
  The inclination gradient is compatible with 0. garound 50 degrees
  A strong gradient in azimuth (from 10 to 50 degrees)

3: umbra
  I & V well fitted
  We obtain a cooler model
  We obtain a significant b gradient decreasing with height from 2 to 1 kG
  The velocity gradient is compatible with 0. Vz around -2 km/s
  The inclination gradient is important going to nearly horizontal at deep layers to
      nearly vertical at surface
  Azimuth is very bad determined (bat fit in Q and U)    

4: facular point close to a sunspot with opposite polarity
  Very well fitted
  Slighly crossing gradients in B and vz to reproduce the assymetry
