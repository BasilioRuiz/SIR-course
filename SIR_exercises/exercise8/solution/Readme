1) In FIRS.pro We restore FIRS_fac1083.save and extract the region from -289.74 to 96.259 nm
and write the profile using write_profile,ind,x,i,q,u,v
u=v=i*0
x is the wavelengt in mA minus the 


2) 
We cp and modify a penumbral model, for instance

cp /home/brc/Boulder/Curso/sir/models/penumjti11.mod .

echo model.mtrol | /home/brc/SIR/SIR2015/modelador3.x

3) We invert I & V using 2 cycles allowing micro and macro
because we have not the PSF

4) Plotting the two cycles models we can see that we can not
consider gradients. We should make a better data reduction
to elliminate frindges and to diminish te noise.
