mkdir Ex9
cd Ex9

;In the terminal 
cp $_exercise9/* .

cp $_default/sir.trol .

1) I have inverted TandPgperturb.per using sir_invTPg.trol  ( cp /home/brc/Curso/BRC/SIR_exercises/exercise9/solution/sir_invTPg.trol .

It uses 4 cycles:

AUTOMATIC SELECT. OF NODES?  :0,0,0,1             
Nodes for temperature 1      :2,2,5,10  
Nodes for electr. press. 1   :0,2,5,10 

In the first one it determines Pe from hydrostatic equilibrium

echo sir_invTPg.trol | $_program/sir.x


2) I have inverted TandPgVzperturb.per using sir_invTPgVz.trol  ( cp /home/brc/Curso/BRC/SIR_exercises/exercise9/solution/sir_invTPgVz.trol .
AUTOMATIC SELECT. OF NODES?  :0,0,0,1             ! (DEFAULT=0=no; 1=yes)
Nodes for temperature 1      :2,2,5,10  
Nodes for electr. press. 1   :0,2,5,10  
Nodes for LOS velocity 1     :2,2,5,10 

cp valc11HE.mod guess.mod
echo sir_invTPgVz.trol | $_program/sir.x

3) To see the sensitivity of the models to T and Gas Pressure perturbations I have wrote 
sensitivity_PG.pro       (cp /home/brc/Curso/BRC/SIR_exercises/exercise9/solution/sensitivity_PG.pro .

This program evaluates the RF to RF to T & Pg from guess_4.mod (running SIR for RF.trol)
( cp /home/brc/Curso/BRC/SIR_exercises/exercise9/solution/RF.trol .  )


where I've evaluated using SIR the RF to T and Pe. 
Applying the chain rule:
dI/dPg = dI/dPe * dPe/dPg + dI/dT* dT/dPg
Then, the RF to Pg can be obtained as
RPg= Rpe/ (dPg/dPe) + RT/ (dPg/dT)

So we need to evaluate dPg/dPe and dPg/dT
The idl procedure Pgderivatives evaluates these derivatives

Pgderivatives,T,Pe,Pg,dlogPgdT,dlogPgdPe

calling to the fortran program 
/home/brc/SIR/program/Pgderivatives_i.x

You can compile these program (in the SIR folder) simply doing
make fc=gfortran Pgderivatives_i.x
or
make Pgderivatives_i.x (if you use ifort compiler)

Then, the relative perturbation it is obtained
multiplying the RF by T and Pg respectively

Plotting it, you can see that the the RF to Pg has its maximum at around logtau=-1.4
0.0027 of perturbation of Intensity for a 10% of perturbation of the Pg.
It implies that we need a least SN=1000 to see this perturbation over the noise
 


















2) We copy and modify a penumbral model, for instance

cp $_models/penumjti11.mod .

IDL> read_model,'penumjti11.mod',logtau,t,pe,mic,b,vz,g,f,z,pg,rho,mac,fill,stray
IDL> b=b*0.+1500. & vz=vz*0. & g=g*0.+45 & f=f*0.+30.
IDL> write_model,'guess1.mod',logtau,t,pe,mic,b,vz,g,f,z,pg,rho,mac,fill,stray

As we want to do several inversions we make some copies of guess1.mod
cp guess1.mod guess2.mod
cp guess1.mod guess3.mod
cp guess1.mod guess4.mod
cp guess1.mod guess5.mod


3) We invert using 2 cycles allowing micro and macro
We edit FIRS1.trol  (cp /home/brc/Curso/BRC/SIR_exercises/exercise8/solution/*.trol .
cp $_default/sir.trol .

kwrite sir.trol --> FIRS1.trol

Invert macroturbulence 1?    :1                ! (0 or blank=no, 1=yes)


and then we copy this in other 4 files
cp FIRS1.mod FIRS2.mod and then modify the input model and output profile name
cp FIRS1.mod FIRS3.mod
cp FIRS1.mod FIRS4.mod
cp FIRS1.mod FIRS5.mod

echo FIRS1.trol | $_program/sir.x
echo FIRS2.trol | $_program/sir.x
etc


we check the results
IDL> graphics2


We can check than for;
1: penumbra
  The fits are reasonably good (except Stokes U core)
  Temperatures are similar to to guess model (typical of a penumbra) 
  We obtain a significant b gradient growing with height from .8 to 1.2 kG
  The velocity gradient is compatible with 0. Vz around -2 km/s
  The inclination gradient is compatible with 0. garound 73 degrees
  A strong gradient in azimuth (from 60 to 115 degrees)


2: light bridge
  Q is badly matched. U-cosre is not too good 
  We obtain a cooler model
  We obtain a significant b gradient growing with height from 1.4 to 2.1 kG
  The velocity gradient is compatible with 0. Vz around -2 km/s
  The inclination gradient is compatible with 0. garound 50 degrees
  A strong gradient in azimuth (from 10 to 50 degrees)

3: umbra
  I & V well fitted
  We obtain a cooler model
  We obtain a significant b gradient decreasing with height from 2 to 1 kG
  The velocity gradient is compatible with 0. Vz around -2 km/s
  The inclination gradient is important going to nearly horizontal at deep layers to
      nearly vertical at surface
  Azimuth is very bad determined (bat fit in Q and U)    

4: facular point close to a sunspot with opposite polarity
  Very well fitted
  Slighly crossing gradients in B and vz to reproduce the assymetry
