1) I have inverted TandPgperturb.per using sir_invTPg.trol
It uses 4 cycles:

AUTOMATIC SELECT. OF NODES?  :0,0,0,1             
Nodes for temperature 1      :2,2,5,10  
Nodes for electr. press. 1   :0,2,5,10 

In the first one it determines Pe from hydrostatic equilibrium

2) I have inverted TandPgVzperturb.per using sir_invTPgVz.trol
AUTOMATIC SELECT. OF NODES?  :0,0,0,1             ! (DEFAULT=0=no; 1=yes)
Nodes for temperature 1      :2,2,5,10  
Nodes for electr. press. 1   :0,2,5,10  
Nodes for LOS velocity 1     :2,2,5,10 

3) To see the sensitivity of the models to T and pressure I have wrote 
sensitivity.pro
where I've evaluated the RF to T and Pe. The I transform to relative perturbation
multiplying by T and Pe respectively

Plotting it you can see that the the RF to Pe has its maximum at around logtau=-0.8
reaching 1.e-3 of perturbation of Intensity for a 10% of perturbation of the Pe. 
Then we will need at least a signal to noise ratio better to 1000 to be able to
find a perturbation of 10% of the Pe.
