Starting from a model with b=1500,  Vz=0.1 km/s
To build it we can copy
for instance hsra11 
and modify it with modelador3.x (or reading with IDL)

cp []/sir/models/hsra11.mod .
cp []/sir/models/model.mtrol .

echo model.mtrol | []/modelador3.x

We edit guess-plage.mod introducing a stray light factor=10 %

Result: Vmac= 2.17 km/s. Vmic ~ 0. Stray=78.7%
      Cross gradients of B and Vlos (B increasing, Vlos decreasing with height)
      typical from a canopy (these gradients are needed to reproduce the assymmetric V shape)
